<h2>Why this matters</h2>
<p>EMI depends on principal, interest and tenure. For a ₹ 1000000 loan at about 9.5% for 20 years, EMI is roughly ₹ 9321.31. Total payment ₹ 2237114.85 with interest near ₹ 1237114.85.</p>
<p>Keep FOIR under ~40–45% and hold a 3–6 month buffer. Affordability is more important than a slightly lower rate.</p>
<p>Prepay early when possible; it reduces future interest the most and can shorten tenure without stress.</p>
<p>Compare effective APR including processing fees and insurance. Do balance transfer only if net savings are meaningful and quick.</p>
<p>A strong bureau score and healthy debt‑to‑income unlock better pricing and smoother documentation.</p>
