<section class="section"><h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>
<div class="card"><p><strong>Are FD rates fixed and how do special rates work?</strong></p><p>FD rates are fixed at booking for the selected tenure. Banks may offer special rates for limited periods or senior citizens. If rates rise later, your existing FD continues at the booked rate; consider laddering new FDs to capture improvements without breaking older ones. Always check compounding frequency and premature withdrawal penalties when comparing headline rates.</p></div>
<div class="card"><p><strong>How is FD interest taxed?</strong></p><p>FD interest is taxable income and may attract TDS beyond thresholds. Plan taxes under your chosen regime and maintain PAN with the bank to avoid higher TDS. If you prefer smoother cash flow, opt for quarterly interest payouts; for higher compounding, choose reinvestment with maturity payout. Keep statements and interest certificates for filing.</p></div>
<div class="card"><p><strong>What is FD laddering and why is it useful?</strong></p><p>Laddering splits your corpus across multiple tenures (e.g., 6, 12 and 24 months). It provides periodic liquidity and lets you reinvest at prevailing rates. Laddering reduces the need to break an FD mid-tenure, avoiding penalties and interest loss. It’s a simple way to balance returns and flexibility.</p></div>
<div class="card"><p><strong>How do premature withdrawal rules impact returns?</strong></p><p>Breaking an FD early typically incurs penalties and interest recalculation at lower rates applicable for the actual holding period. If you expect potential cash needs, ladder or maintain a liquid buffer in savings or a short-term FD to avoid breaking long-tenure deposits.</p></div>
<div class="card"><p><strong>FD vs RD—when to choose which?</strong></p><p>FD suits lump-sum investments; RD suits monthly savings discipline. RD interest accrues with periodic deposits and similar rates to FDs for matching tenures. If you have a bonus or windfall, FD makes sense; for steady savings, RD helps you build over time without market risk.</p></div>
<div class="card"><p><strong>Are senior citizen FDs better?</strong></p><p>Senior citizens often receive higher rates and enhanced features. If investing for parents, open accounts in their names with proper nominations and keep documentation organized. Evaluate bank safety, convenience, and payout options alongside rates.</p></div>
<div class="card"><p><strong>What about bank safety and insurance?</strong></p><p>Bank deposits are subject to regulatory protections up to a certain limit per bank as per prevailing insurance schemes. Diversify across strong institutions if your corpus is large. Review service quality and online access—smooth management matters as much as headline rates.</p></div>
<div class="card"><p><strong>FD vs debt mutual funds?</strong></p><p>Debt funds can offer market-linked returns and indexation benefits depending on policy environments. They carry market and interest-rate risks, while FDs offer guaranteed returns. Choose based on risk tolerance, horizon and tax considerations. For zero-volatility needs, FDs are simpler; for flexibility and potentially higher tax efficiency, explore debt funds thoughtfully.</p></div>
<div class="card"><p><strong>Any simple checklist before booking?</strong></p><p>Confirm tenure, rate, compounding, payout mode, premature penalty, and nomination details. Keep KYC updated and set maturity alerts. Use our <a href="/tools/fd-rd.html">FD / RD Calculator</a> to estimate maturity values and choose ladder sizes that suit your liquidity needs.</p></div>
