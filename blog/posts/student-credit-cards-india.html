<section class="section"><h2>FAQs</h2>
<div class="card"><p><strong>Minimum income and eligibility?</strong></p><p>Student cards often accept lower income profiles or require a co-applicant or fixed deposits for secured variants. Eligibility depends on issuer policies, city and documentation. Build trust by maintaining a bank account with regular credits and avoiding bounced payments. If offered a tiny limit, accept initially and seek enhancements later based on usage and timely payments.</p></div>
<div class="card"><p><strong>Does an annual fee make sense for students?</strong></p><p>It can, if rewards exceed the fee and match your spending categories. Many issuers run lifetime-free campaigns through authorized partners; watch for those. If a card has a fee, check for milestone waivers or welcome vouchers that offset cost. Avoid paying for features you won’t use; simplicity beats complexity when you’re starting out.</p></div>
<div class="card"><p><strong>How should I use the first card safely?</strong></p><p>Keep the limit modest and spend only what you can repay in full every cycle. Enable app alerts and set auto-pay for the total amount due. Avoid cash advances and unknown online portals. Treat the card as a convenience tool and a track record builder rather than a source of credit to stretch budgets.</p></div>
<div class="card"><p><strong>Can I build credit without overspending?</strong></p><p>Yes. Make small, planned purchases like essentials and pay in full early. Maintain utilization under 30% and avoid multiple new applications. If you need to split a purchase, estimate costs with the <a href="/tools/credit-card-emi.html">Credit Card EMI Calculator</a> and confirm fees before converting.</p></div>
<div class="card"><p><strong>What if I miss a payment?</strong></p><p>Pay immediately and call the issuer to understand charges. Set up stronger reminders and ensure sufficient balance before due dates. A single miss is recoverable, but repeated delays harm your profile and can lead to fee pile-ups. Keep at least a small buffer in your account near statement dates.</p></div>
<div class="card"><p><strong>Are co-branded student cards better?</strong></p><p>Co-branded cards can be valuable if you frequently use partner platforms (travel, food delivery, shopping). Confirm reward ceilings, exclusions and network acceptance at campuses or local merchants. Don’t choose a card solely for a one-time offer—sustained value matters.</p></div>
<div class="card"><p><strong>How soon can I get a limit increase?</strong></p><p>Issuers may offer limit reviews after 6–12 months based on responsible usage. Submit updated income documents if requested. Accept only increases that you can manage safely; higher limits help utilization but aren’t a reason to spend more.</p></div>
<div class="card"><p><strong>Any quick checklist?</strong></p><p>Enable notifications and auto-pay, keep utilization low, redeem rewards on time, and secure your card details. Review statements monthly and dispute errors promptly. These simple habits build a strong foundation for future credit needs.</p></div>
