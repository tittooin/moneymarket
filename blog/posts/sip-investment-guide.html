<section class="section"><h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>
<div class="card"><p><strong>Can I change my SIP amount and date?</strong></p><p>Most platforms allow increasing or decreasing monthly contributions and changing the SIP date. If you alter the amount, ensure your budget can sustain it even during tight months. Choosing a date soon after salary credit helps avoid missed debits. For yearly step-ups, set calendar reminders or use auto step-up features where available to grow contributions without manual effort every year.</p></div>
<div class="card"><p><strong>Are SIP returns guaranteed?</strong></p><p>No. Mutual fund returns depend on market performance and fund management. SIPs reduce timing risk through rupee-cost averaging but cannot eliminate market risk. Long horizons improve the likelihood of positive outcomes; diversify across equity and debt funds based on goals and risk tolerance. Review fund consistency, expense ratios and drawdown behavior, not just recent returns.</p></div>
<div class="card"><p><strong>Which funds should I choose?</strong></p><p>For core equity exposure, consider diversified index funds or consistent large-cap funds. For long-term goals (10+ years), a mix of flexi-cap and mid-cap funds may be suitable if you accept volatility. For short-term needs (under 3 years), stick to low-risk debt funds. Avoid chasing last year’s top performer and use SIP to build positions over time. Check expense ratios and track record across market cycles.</p></div>
<div class="card"><p><strong>How do taxes work on SIPs?</strong></p><p>Equity fund gains held over 12 months qualify for long-term capital gains with current concessionary rates and thresholds; under 12 months they are short-term gains. Debt fund taxation depends on current rules; consult updated guidelines before planning redemptions. ELSS funds offer Section 80C benefits with a three-year lock-in. Always verify recent tax changes and keep statements organized for filing.</p></div>
<div class="card"><p><strong>What is rupee-cost averaging?</strong></p><p>By investing a fixed amount regularly, you buy more units when markets fall and fewer when they rise. Over time this averages the purchase price and reduces timing risk. It doesn’t guarantee higher returns, but it improves discipline and reduces the tendency to buy only after rallies. Pair averaging with a long-term horizon and periodic portfolio reviews.</p></div>
<div class="card"><p><strong>Should I pause SIPs during downturns?</strong></p><p>Downturns can be uncomfortable, but SIPs are most valuable when markets are weak because you accumulate more units at lower prices. Pausing can be considered if income is strained, but restarting quickly is important to preserve compounding. If anxiety is high, shift a portion to low-volatility funds rather than stopping completely.</p></div>
<div class="card"><p><strong>What is SIP step-up?</strong></p><p>Step-up increases your monthly SIP by a fixed percentage or amount every year, aligning contributions with income growth. A 10% annual step-up can meaningfully boost corpus over long horizons without requiring large upfront amounts. Use calculators to simulate corpus with and without step-up to appreciate the impact.</p></div>
<div class="card"><p><strong>Can I switch funds later?</strong></p><p>Yes. You can redeem and reinvest or use STP (systematic transfer plan) from one fund to another over time. Be mindful of exit loads, tax implications and market conditions when switching. Document your rationale—style shifts (e.g., large-cap to multi-cap) should be strategic, not reactive.</p></div>
<div class="card"><p><strong>Direct vs regular plans?</strong></p><p>Direct plans have lower expense ratios because they exclude distributor commissions, potentially increasing long-term returns. Regular plans include advisory support; choose based on your comfort managing investments. If you prefer guidance, ensure the advice is goal-based and not purely commission-driven.</p></div>
<div class="card"><p><strong>How to review performance?</strong></p><p>Set a yearly review to check fund performance against benchmarks and peers. Evaluate rolling returns, downside protection and consistency, not just point-to-point returns. Avoid frequent changes—compounding needs time. Rebalance if allocations drift significantly from your plan.</p></div>
